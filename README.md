Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification
Overview
This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook that utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically the VGG16 model, to classify histopathological images of breast tissue into benign or malignant categories. The project uses the BreakHis dataset, applying machine learning techniques to enhance the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
Dataset
The BreakHis dataset contains microscopic images of breast tumor tissue, categorized under various magnifications (40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X). This dataset is publicly available and can be accessed here https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jxwvdwhpc2/1
Repository Contents
•	Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the VGG16 model and the analysis of its performance on the BreakHis dataset.
•	README.md: This document providing an overview and instructions for the project.
Installation
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can install the necessary Python libraries required for this project by running:
